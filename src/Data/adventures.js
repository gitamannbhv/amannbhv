      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Why I Built This</h3>
      <p class="mb-6">
        I solve LeetCode regularly, but manually pushing solutions to GitHub is slow, repetitive, and honestly not sustainable.
        I also didn’t like the security tradeoff of browser extensions that ask for broad permissions and could expose sensitive session data.
        So I built a small GitHub Actions workflow that syncs my accepted LeetCode submissions into my repo automatically—securely, using GitHub Secrets.

      </div>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-10">What This Automation Does</h3>
      <ul class="mb-6 list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Runs on a schedule (daily) and can also be triggered manually from the Actions tab.</li>
        <li>Pulls your accepted LeetCode submissions and commits them into your GitHub repository.</li>
        <li>Keeps credentials out of code by storing them as encrypted GitHub Secrets.</li>
      </ul>

      <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-green-500 pl-4 my-8 italic">
        “The best automation is the one you set up once and then forget—until you notice your GitHub quietly filling up with proof of work.”

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-10">DIY Setup (Beginner-Friendly)</h3>

      <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">Step 1 — Create a GitHub repo</h4>
      <p class="mb-6">
        Create (or pick) a repository where you want your LeetCode solutions to be saved.
        This can be public or private.
      </p>

      <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">Step 2 — Get your LeetCode cookies (CSRF + Session)</h4>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Open <span class="font-semibold">leetcode.com</span>, log in, then open Developer Tools:
        right click → <span class="font-semibold">Inspect</span>.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        Now go to <span class="font-semibold">Application</span> (Chrome/Edge) or <span class="font-semibold">Storage</span> (Firefox).
        Look for <span class="font-semibold">Cookies</span> → <span class="font-semibold">https://leetcode.com</span>.
      </p>

      <ul class="mb-6 list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Copy the cookie named <span class="font-semibold">csrftoken</span></li>
        <li>Copy the cookie named <span class="font-semibold">LEETCODE_SESSION</span></li>
      </ul>

      <div class="my-8 rounded-xl border overflow-hidden">
        <img src="/stories/leetsync/leetcode.png" alt="LeetCode Cookies" class="w-full h-auto" />
      </div>

      <p class="mb-6">
        Security note: treat these values like passwords. Don’t paste them into public chats, don’t commit them into code,
        and rotate them anytime you suspect they’ve been exposed.
      </p>

      <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">Step 3 — Add GitHub Secrets</h4>
      <p class="mb-4">
        In your GitHub repo: <span class="font-semibold">Settings</span> → <span class="font-semibold">Secrets and variables</span> → <span class="font-semibold">Actions</span> → <span class="font-semibold">New repository secret</span>.
      </p>

      <ul class="mb-6 list-disc pl-6 space-y-2">
        <li>Create a secret named <span class="font-semibold">LEETCODE_CSRF_TOKEN</span> and paste your <span class="font-semibold">csrftoken</span> value.</li>
        <li>Create a secret named <span class="font-semibold">LEETCODE_SESSION</span> and paste your <span class="font-semibold">LEETCODE_SESSION</span> value.</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="my-8 rounded-xl border overflow-hidden">
        <img src="/stories/leetsync/secrets_github.png" alt="GitHub Secrets" class="w-full h-auto" />
      </div>

      <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">Step 4 — Create the workflow file</h4>
      <p class="mb-4">
        In your repository, create this exact folder path:
        <span class="font-semibold">.github/workflows/</span>
        and add a file named:
        <span class="font-semibold">leet_sync.yaml</span>
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        Paste this workflow (you can keep the SEO comments, they don’t affect execution):
      </p>

      <pre class="overflow-x-auto rounded-xl border p-4 mb-6">

  on:
    workflow_dispatch:
    schedule:
      # Runs automatically every day at 11:55 PM IST (which is 6:25 PM UTC)

            leetcode-session: ${'$'}{{ secrets.LEETCODE_SESSION }}
            destination-folder: my-leetcode-solutions
  </code></pre>

      <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-3 mt-6">Step 5 — Run it manually once</h4>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Go to your repo → <span class="font-semibold">Actions</span> → select <span class="font-semibold">Sync Leetcode</span> →
        click <span class="font-semibold">Run workflow</span>.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-6">
        The first run confirms your secrets and permissions are correct. After that, the scheduled cron will keep it running automatically.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-10">What Happens After Setup?</h3>
      <p class="mb-6">
        From this point onward, whenever you submit and get an <span class="font-semibold">Accepted</span> solution on LeetCode,
        the next workflow run will sync it into your GitHub repository under
        <span class="font-semibold">my-leetcode-solutions/</span>.
        Your GitHub becomes a living archive of consistent practice—without manual effort.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-10">Summary</h3>
      <p class="mb-6">
        This is a simple, secure automation: extract two LeetCode cookies, store them as GitHub Secrets,
        add one YAML workflow file, run it once manually, and then let GitHub Actions handle the rest daily.
        It saves time, avoids extension-based credential risk, and keeps your progress visible and organized.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Origin Story</h3>
      <p class="mb-6">
        I was born in Sikahar, a rural village in Bihar. While many see lack of infrastructure as a disadvantage, I saw an opportunity: 
        minimal light pollution. The night skies were pristine canvases of cosmic history.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-6">
        What started as simple stargazing evolved into an obsession with celestial mechanics. I didn't just want to watch; I wanted to discover.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">The NASA Collaboration</h3>
      <p class="mb-6">
        Through my organization, DeuxStem, I facilitated a partnership with the International Astronomical Search Collaboration (IASC), 
        a NASA-affiliated citizen science program. We analyze real astronomical data to identify Near-Earth Objects (NEOs).

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">The Problem</h3>
      <p class="mb-6">
        Rockets fight two enemies: gravity and atmosphere. Most fuel is burned just fighting through the thick lower atmosphere ("the soup"). 
        I wondered: Why fight it when you can float above it?
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">The "Crazy" Solution</h3>
      <p class="mb-6">
        VYOMAGAMI is a hybrid launch architecture. We use high-altitude weather balloons to lift the launch vehicle to the stratosphere (approx. 30km). 
        At this altitude, 99% of the atmospheric mass is below us.
      </p>
      
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Stage 0:</strong> Balloon ascent (Zero fuel).</li>
        <li><strong>Stage 1:</strong> Rocket ignition in near-vacuum (Max efficiency).</li>
        <li><strong>Result:</strong> 60-70% reduction in fuel mass and structural weight.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="mb-6">
        I presented this concept at SpaceOnova, detailing the physics simulations that validate the delta-V savings. It's bold, it's risky, and it's exactly the kind of engineering challenge I live for.

      <p class="mb-6">
        Trees are great, but they are slow. To tackle the climate crisis, we need industrial-scale carbon removal. 
        Existing Direct Air Capture (DAC) is too expensive ($600/ton). I set out to build a machine that "breathes" CO2 more efficiently than nature.
      </p>

      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">The Innovation</h3>
      <p class="mb-6">
        PAVANA utilizes a novel gradient composite metal chamber (Cast Iron + Copper). This creates extreme temperature differentials (250-400°C) 
        driven entirely by concentrated solar thermal power.
      </p>
      <p class="mb-6">
        By optimizing the phase-transition mechanism of the capture solution, we reduced the projected cost to <strong>$94-232 per ton</strong>. 
        Currently, I'm building a digital twin to simulate airflow patterns within the corrugated metal maze structure.
