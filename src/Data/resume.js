  role: "AI RESEARCHER / ENGINEER",
  about: "I call myself a 'Genetically Engineered Learner'. I didn't inherit talent—I built it through obsessive curiosity. I refuse to learn for grades; I learn to understand real-world problems like climate change and financial exclusion, then engineer intelligent agents and scalable systems to solve them.",
