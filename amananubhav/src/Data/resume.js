  role: "AI RESEARCHER / ENGINEER",
  about: "I didn't inherit talent—I built it. I call myself a 'Genetically Engineered Learner'. I refuse to learn for grades; instead, I learn to understand real-world problems like climate change and financial exclusion, then engineer intelligent agents and scalable systems to solve them.",
  philosophy: "The gap between what we know and what we could solve drives everything I do. Climate change, financial exclusion, accessibility—these aren't abstract concepts. They're problems waiting for someone willing to learn deeply enough to fix them.",
